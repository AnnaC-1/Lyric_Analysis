# Lyric_Analysis
A personal project to continue practicing Python skills and to learn a bit about the basics of NLP, EDA, and Web scraping/crawling.

-Web scraping for HTML parsing, data extraction, and session management to get song titles and lyrics
-Implemented data manipulation, text processing, topic modeling, and data visualization for a clear efficient 
analysis and presentation
-Integrated calculating correlation coefficients, performing sentiment analysis, applying Markov modeling for 
text analysis, and working with HTTP requests and networking for data retrieval 

Note: Each artist goes through the same steps in the EDA process and is explained identically.
